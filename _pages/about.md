About Me
--------
I'm a second year Ph.D. student from the [Deparment of Mechanical Engineering](https://me.udel.edu/) at the [University of Delaware (UD)](https://www.udel.edu/). I work as a research assistant in the Soft Microrobots for Tissue Engineering Lab (SMT), supervied by [Dr.Sambeeta Das](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Vca88o4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works). My research interest includes Microrobots Control, Microrobots Locomotion, and Micromanipulator Design.

I obtained my B.E. in Measurement, Control Technology and Instrumentation from the [Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU)](http://en.bjtu.edu.cn/) in 2019 and M.Sc. in Robotics from the [University of Bristol (UoB)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) in 2020. During my graduate study, I was a master thesis student in the [Bristol Robotics Laboratory(BRL)], supervised by [Dr. Matthew Hale](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=oSSpCwUAAAAJ).

Before joining UD, I worked as a research assistant in the [Advanced Actuators and Robotics Lab (AAR)](https://wanglab.mee.sustech.edu.cn) at the [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), supervied by [Dr. Hongqiang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5jtC1ggAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) for 2 years.
