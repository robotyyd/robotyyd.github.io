Different kinds of magnetic tweezers that I developed: tri-pole, quadru-pole, 2D, and 3D.

Magnetic tweezers employ electromagnetic coils and tip-shaped poles to create a magnetic field gradient, thereby exerting a magnetic force on magnetic particles when an input current is applied to the coils. 

The yoke is 3D printed using Metal PLA. The magnetic poles are constructed from a Nickel-Iron soft ferromagnetic alloy (Mu-Metal). The electromagnetic coils are wound with 28 AWG Enameled Copper Wire.
