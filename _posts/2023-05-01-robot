In this project,  allow quadruped robots to acquire mobility through joint evolution, and we can also obtain genetic information on individuals who move faster. After the evolution is completed, 100 generations of 50 in each generation are obtained for a total of 5000 individuals. Finally, the individual with the largest fitness value is selected to find the corresponding genome information. This individual is the best individual we need under the fitness function. Through the statistics of the experimental results, the two quadruped robots have different fitness values, indicating that the shape of the robot also affects the evolution results. Therefore, to design a better individual, it is necessary to evolve not only its joints (controllers), but also the shape of the robot. In addition, legged robots can gain mobility and increase speed through evolution, that is, they can evolve and adapt according to human requirements.
