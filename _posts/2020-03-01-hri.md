This project is a human-computer interaction research based on SoftBank’s social robot NAO. In order to explore the impact of robot feedback on human-computer interaction and promote the development of social interactive entertainment robots, we designed a small game for experimentation. The experiment consisted of 16 participants, 4 NAO robots and a computer with Choregraphe installed. Participants were divided into two groups, one group played an action imitation game only with NAO. On this basis, we asked NAO to recognize the facial expressions of another group of participants during the game, and then gave certain feedback. Experimental results were evaluated by playtime, participants’ expressions, and questionnaires. The results showed that a certain amount of feedback led to a better experience for participants, who felt more fulfilling and interesting. Therefore, feedback can increase the fun of the human-computer interaction process and make the interaction process longer and deeper.
