In this project, a joint from the EPSRC-funded Autonomous Robot Evolution Project was used to construct two different quadruped robots in V-REP, and neuroevolutionary method was used to evolve the robots joints. The purpose of this research is to allow quadruped robots to acquire mobility through joint evolution, and we can also obtain genetic information on individuals who move faster. After the evolution is completed, 100 generations of 50 in each generation are obtained
for a total of 5000 individuals. Finally, the individual with the largest fitness value is selected to find the corresponding
genome information. This individual is the best individual we need under the fitness function. Through the statistics of
the experimental results, the two quadruped robots have different fitness values, indicating that the shape of the robot
also affects the evolution results. Therefore, to design a better individual, it is necessary to evolve not only its joints
(controllers), but also the shape of the robot. In addition, legged robots can gain mobility and increase speed through
evolution, that is, they can evolve and adapt according to human requirements.
