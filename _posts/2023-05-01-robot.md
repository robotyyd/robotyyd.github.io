This project was undertaken as part of the graduate course MEEG667 Mechatronics at UD by Dr. Adam Wickenheiser. Our challenge was to create an intelligent vehicle, designed to complete three distinct milestones, each with its own set of tasks.

For the initial two milestones, I designed a two-wheeled robot equipped with an accelerometer, enabling it to self-balance. The robot's robust design performed exceptionally well across various surfaces. Even when pushed, it quickly returned to a balanced position. To further enhance its functionality, I developed a custom wireless controller to adjust its speed and direction.

The final milestone is basically a competition. Given the specific challenges of this stage, I gave up the original two-wheeled design, adding two more wheels for balance. Additionally, I integrated a lifting mechanism, powered by two microservo motors, capable of picking up boxes from the ground. The vehicle also featured a range of sensors for the specific tasks at this milestone.
