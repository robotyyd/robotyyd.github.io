This project presents a high-speed railway foreign object detection system that automatically identifies foreign object in the railway environment, providing timely alerts to prevent potential accidents. By using deep learning techniques, the system significantly reduces the need for manual inspection while improving detection accuracy and efficiency. The core of the system is the application of the SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) algorithm, based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to detect foreign objects along railway lines. The trained model demonstrates rapid and precise foreign object detection across diverse railway environments and varying weather conditions, ensuring robustness and adaptability. This system is of great significance to enhance railway safety operations.
