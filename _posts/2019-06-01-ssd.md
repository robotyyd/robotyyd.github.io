This project proposes a high-speed railway foreign body detection system, which can automatically detect foreign bodies in the railway line environment and alert the train in time. The system can greatly save manpower and material resources and improve detection efficiency and accuracy. The system mainly studies the application of SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) algorithm based on CNN (convolutional neural network) in railway foreign object detection. A dataset in VOC2007 format containing 15,000 pictures of trains and pedestrians on railway lines was made for training deep neural networks. The trained model performs foreign object detection in different railway scenes and in different weather, and can detect pedestrians and trains quickly and accurately. The adaptability of the model under different conditions is verified. Therefore, the system is of great significance to improve the level of railway safety operation.
