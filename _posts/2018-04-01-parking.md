Fischertechnik parts are used to build an urban underground intelligent circular parking lot. People only need to press a button on the user interface, and the parking lot can automatically store or remove the car. Not only does this save floor space, it also allows for quick and efficient parking or picking up. The main work is to design and model a novel parking mechanism and system. We use Fischertechnik parts to make functional models and use various sensors and efficient programs for motion control.
