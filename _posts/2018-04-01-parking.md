This project aims to design and model an innovative underground circular parking system using Fischertechnik components. The system enables fully automated car storage and retrieval, maximizing space efficiency and minimizing the time required for parking. The focus is on developing a novel parking mechanism and control system, integrating sensors and optimized motion control algorithms to ensure smooth and efficient operation.
