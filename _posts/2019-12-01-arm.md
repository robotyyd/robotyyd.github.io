This project is mainly based on MATLAB Robotics Toolbox to analyze the forward and inverse kinematics and workspace of the Lynxmotion robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom, and also draws the motion animation of the robotic arm and the motion trajectory of the end effector. Knowing the length and rotation angle of each segment of the manipulator, the position of the end effector can be obtained by analyzing the DH parameters and transformation matrix. On the contrary, knowing the position of the end effector, the rotation angle of each segment of the manipulator can be obtained through inverse kinematics. The workspace consists of 24*12*12*12*6 points. The motion animation of the robotic arm and the motion trajectory of the end effector can be drawn through the fkine and ikine functions of the toolbox. Trajectory planning can be better achieved by studying the workspace and inverse kinematics of the manipulator.
