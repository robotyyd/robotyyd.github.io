This project was part of the graduate course MEEG671: Introduction to Robotics at UD, under the guidance of Dr. Panagiotis Artemiadis. We are required to develop a 7-DOF manipulator (LBR iiwa 7 R800, KUKA) capable of positioning accurately based on the recognition of Aruco Marker.

The project aims to create a trajectory for the manipulator with a camera and rectangular shape attachment. The objective is to accurately position the shape over a target using an Aruco marker for location and orientation. The manipulator begins at configuration q1 and must avoid hitting the surface during movement. The desired outcome is a joint space trajectory that guides the manipulator from its starting point to successfully aligning the shape with the target.

Works for this project:
* Analyzed DH parameters, transformation matrices, forward kinematics, and inverse kinematics using the inverse Jacobian.
* Trajectory planning.
* Simulation Validation using CoppeliaSim.
* The final end effector position error, computed in MATLAB, was only around 0.003mm.
