This project aims to create an automatic tracking robot system Romi, which can follow the black line on the specified map
and return to the starting point. The robot uses three-channel infrared as the sensor, AVR ATMEGA 32u4 as the control
chip, and PID as the control method. Romi uses two-wheel differential steering for a tighter turning radius and faster
speed. In addition, Romi has a search function. When no black line is detected, Romi will rotate left and right until it
finds the black line again or ends the tracking. After completing the tracking, it will get its current position and direction
according to the rotation of the motors on both sides, and then calculate the shortest path to the starting point. Finally
rotate to the direction of the path and follow that direction back to the starting point.
